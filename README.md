<Diagram @ref="Diagram">
    <Nodes>
        <Node Id="abc" X="500" Y="500">
            Hello node @context.Id
        </Node>
        <Node Id="def" X="1000" Y="500">

This is of course only a minimalistic example.
For more examples, have a look at [the sample project](https://github.com/excubo-ag/Blazor.Diagrams/tree/main/TestProject_Components), which is the basis for the [demo application](https://excubo-ag.github.io/Blazor.Diagrams/).

## Design principles

- Extensibility

Users get a set of built-in node shapes and link types, but can expand this freely and with minimal amount of effort by adding their own shapes.

- Blazor API

The API should feel like you're using Blazor, not a javascript library.

- Minimal js, minimal css, lazy-loaded only when you use the component

The non-C# part of the code of the library should be as tiny as possible. We set ourselves a maximum amount of 10kB for combined js+css.
The current payload is less than 100 bytes, and only gets loaded dynamically when the component is actually used.

## How to design a custom node

A complete example of how to design a custom node is available [here](https://github.com/excubo-ag/Blazor.Diagrams/blob/main/TestProject_Components/Pages/UserDefinedNode.razor).

## Roadmap

There are more features to come! Goals include:

- More node types
- auto-layout
